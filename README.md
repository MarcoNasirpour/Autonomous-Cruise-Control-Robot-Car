# Autonomous Cruise-Control Robot Car 

An embedded systems project using an STM32 Nucleo-F411RE to implement a simple autonomous cruise-control robot.  
The system adjusts motor speed in real-time based on **ultrasonic distance sensing**, preventing collisions with obstacles.  

## Features
- Real-time obstacle detection using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor (with voltage divider).  
- Dual DC motor control using PWM signals on STM32.  
- Integrated L298N motor driver, LED alert indicator, and rechargeable battery pack.  
- Programmed in **C** using STM32CubeIDE with HAL libraries.  

## Hardware
- STM32 Nucleo-F411RE  
- L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor  
- 2WD Robot Chassis with Dual DC Motors  
- Rechargeable AA Battery Pack  
- Breadboard, resistors, jumper wires
